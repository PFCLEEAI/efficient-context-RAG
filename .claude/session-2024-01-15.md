# Session Summary: efficient-context-RAG Creation

**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Context at save:** 59% (119k/200k tokens)

## What Was Built

**Repository:** https://github.com/PFCLEEAI/efficient-context-RAG

### Core Files Created
- `README.md` - Full system with token efficiency comparisons (73k tokens saved)
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Daily cheat sheet
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guide
- `docs/semantic-rag-upgrade.md` - Local (Ollama) + API (OpenAI) options
- `docs/security.md` - What NOT to store
- `docs/benchmarks.md` - Real session data from OpenWhispr (67% context)

### Key Metrics Documented
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Context at start | 50-80k | 5-10k |
| Usable space | 120-150k | 180-190k |
| Cross-session | Re-explain 15k | MCP search 500 |
| Compression rate | N/A | 91% |

### Semantic RAG Options Added
- **Local:** Ollama + ChromaDB (free, private)
- **API:** OpenAI/Voyage/Cohere ($0.02/month)
- Full Python scripts for both

## Key Discussion Points

1. **Current system is NOT true semantic RAG** - it's structured context management
2. **For larger projects (200+ entities)** - semantic RAG recommended
3. **Autocompact buffer is NOT storage** - just headroom for summarization
4. **User wants automatic compression** - not manual

## Open Issue

User correctly identified that:
- Compression should be AUTOMATIC, not manual
- Messages should archive to RAG before being lost
- Target: maintain 20-40% free space continuously

## Next Steps
- Add auto-compression hook/script
- Implement continuous RAG archiving
